# Prost is used to deal with protobuf serialization and deserialization.

# Prost doesn't generate any introspection stuff, so we hack that stuff in with
# our own procedural macros.

# Google/protobuf has a funny idea about case conventions (it converts them all
# over the place) and prost remaps to Rust's conventions to boot. So, to
# recover the original names as much as possible, we need some case conversion
# of our own.
heck = "0.5"

# The schema for the extension files uses jsonschema syntax. The rust crate for
# schema validation with this format this uses serde_json types as input for
# both the schema and the input, so we need to depend on that as well, even
# though we don't actually do any JSON serialization and deserialization.

# Used for checking identifier syntax (could be removed if regexes don't end up
# being useful elsewhere too).

# URLs will work without adding a custom resolver.
