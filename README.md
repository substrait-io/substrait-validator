This repository contains an EXPERIMENTAL validator for
[Substrait](https://github.com/substrait-io/substrait) plans. It's written in
Rust, but bindings are available for Python and C. Other languages may use the
C API via their respective foreign function interface systems.

Substrait version support
-------------------------

Currently, each version of the validator only targets a subset of the available
Substrait versions. Whenever Substrait makes a breaking change that affects
validation, the validator will be updated accordingly and drop support for the
older version. Refer to the table below for the version compatibility matrix.

| Substrait...   | ... is supported by validator ...    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 0.20.x         | 0.0.11 (current version)             |
| 0.19.x         | 0.0.10                               |
| 0.18.x         | 0.0.9                                |
| 0.9.x - 0.17.x | 0.0.8                                |
| 0.7.x - 0.8.x  | 0.0.7                                |
| 0.5.x - 0.6.x  | 0.0.6                                |
| 0.3.x - 0.4.x  | 0.0.4 - 0.0.5                        |
| older          | try 0.0.1, but your mileage may vary |

As Substrait and the validator stabilize and breaking changes become less
frequent, the intention is to support more versions within a single validator
version.

Command-line interface
----------------------

The easiest way to play around with the validator is via the command-line
interface provided by the Python `substrait-validator` module. You can install
this from PyPI using pip:

```console
user@host:~$ pip install substrait-validator
```

You can also build it from source if you want; see the `py` subdirectory. After
installing, you should be able to run:

```console
user@host:~$ substrait-validator
Missing input file. Try --help for usage information.
```

If that doesn't work, try `python3 -m substrait-validator`.

Without any options, the validator will decode the given input file based on
the format implied by the file extension, validate the plan, print any
diagnostics encountered, and fail with code 1 if the validator determines that
the plan is invalid. Here's a valid YAML plan as a starting point for playing
around with it:

```yaml
relations:
- rel:
    read:
      namedTable:
        names:
        - person
      baseSchema:
        names:
        - name
        struct:
          nullability: NULLABILITY_REQUIRED
          types:
          - string:
              nullability: NULLABILITY_REQUIRED
```

When you save that as a `.yaml` file and pass it to the validator, it will
simply exit with code 0 without printing anything. Of course, it's more
interesting to try a plan that *isn't* valid, but we'll leave that as an
excercise to the reader. Note that the validator supports other file types as
well, including JSON, [JDOT](https://github.com/saulpw/jdot), and binary
protobuf files, distinguishing between them using the file extension by
default. You can also specify the format manually using `--in-type`.

It's also more interesting to have the validator tell you how it interpreted
the plan. Let's change the command line to do that:

```console
user@host:~$ substrait-validator input.yaml --out-file output.html --mode ignore
```

This generates `output.html`, a self-contained HTML file describing the plan.
Just like the input file, the output file format is derived from the file
extension, so the `.html` part is significant.

The validator only emits an output file if it exits with code 0, and exits
with code 1 if validation fails, to play nicely with build systems like `make`.
`--mode ignore` just tells the validator to ignore the validation result, so it
always emits the file. The full list of modes is:

 - `strict`: fail unless the plan was proven to be valid;
 - `loose` (default): fail if the plan was proven to be invalid;
 - `ignore`: ignore the validation result (the plan still needs some level of
   sanity for the validator to succeed; for example, the file must exist, and
   must decode according to the specified file format);
 - `convert`: don't run validation at all; instead, only convert between
   different representations of the given `substrait.Plan` message. For
   example, you can use this to convert between the binary protobuf
   serialization format and any of the text-based formats supported by the
   validator.

Note that, without `--mode convert`, the output message type will be
`subtrait.validator.ParseResult` rather than `substrait.Plan` if you use any of
the protobuf-like serialization formats. This message type is a meta
description of the incoming `substrait.Plan` message, with all the information
gathered by the validator annotated to the nodes. The HTML format is pretty
much just a pretty-printed version of this format. More information about this
type is available in
[the associated `.proto` file](proto/substrait/validator/tree.proto).

For more information, use the `--help` option.

Library usage
-------------

For library usage information, refer to the readme files for the language that
you want to use the library from.

Diagnostics
-----------

The primary output of the validator (beyond its validity verdict) is a list of
diagnostics. In fact, the validator derives its verdict from this list. Each
diagnostic consists of the following bits of information:

 - a severity, being either info, warning, or error;
 - a classification, represented using a 4-digit diagnostic code;
 - a cause description; and
 - a path into the protobuf/YAML tree, pointing to the node that the diagnostic
   originated from.

The severity levels strictly map as follows:

 - an error means that something is invalid;
 - a warning means that something may or may not be invalid (i.e. validity
   could not be determined for some reason); and
 - info has no effect on validity.

Once the validator as gathered all diagnostics, the validity of the plan is
simply determined by the above mapping applied to the highest severity level
encountered.

Note that the command line interface specifically could be said to have an
extra "fatal" level. Such fatal diagnostics are not strictly diagnostics in the
sense that they are validation results; they simply indicate that the CLI
returned a non-zero exit code and why.

Severity levels can be clamped to a certain range, distinguished by their
classification. On the command line, the syntax for this is
`--diagnostic-level <code> <min-severity> <max-severity>`, where the severity
levels can be `info`, `warning`, or `error`. This allows you to, for example,
disable warnings of a certain type by clamping them down to `info` when you
know that those particular warnings are not of interest to your application
(`--diagnostic-level <code> info info`), raise severity to `error` if you
want the validator to be extra pedantic about something
(`--diagnostic-level <code> error error`), or reduce the severity of errors to
warnings without affecting info messages
(`--diagnostic-level <code> info warning`). Because the validator derives its
verdict from the highest-severity diagnostic encountered, clamping severity
levels may also change the verdict.

You can request the list of diagnostic codes from the command-line interface
using the `--help-diagnostics` flag:

```console
user@host:~$ substrait-validator --help-diagnostics
The following diagnostic codes are defined:

0000 (Unclassified): unclassified diagnostic.
 |- 0001 (NotYetImplemented): not yet implemented.
 |- 0002 (IllegalValue): illegal value.
...
```

Diagnostic codes are organized in a tree. When you configure the severity range
of a diagnostic code with children, its children will inherit this
configuration, unless they themselves are also explicitly configured. For
example, you can disable all warnings and errors except for those corresponding
to one particular diagnostic by clamping code 0000 down to info only, and then
overriding the configuration for the diagnostic you're interested in back to
the full info to error range.
